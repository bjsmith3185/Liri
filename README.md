# Liri
using node for a search program

Three .js files were created

1) liri_without_log.js
    - this file will run liri but with out logging the results to log.txt
    - this file was created first and added to.

2) liri.js
    - this file will run liri and store the results in log.txt

3) liri_with_inquirer.js
    - this file uses inqirer to prompt the user for specific answers, still allowing the user to enter custom search variables.
    - as of now this file doesnt log the search results to log.txt.
